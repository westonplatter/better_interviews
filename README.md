=================

While fixing bugs and browsing solutions on stackoverflow.com, you see 
an interesting job. You read the description, and the gig seems way
more execiting than fixing the 20 bugs in your work que.

You apply for the job, and have a phone screen with HR. The 
enthusiastic HR recruiter describes, 
- an amazing in-house team  
- importance of giving back to Open Source  
- your value to the company because of your work with XYZ  

After the phone screen, you easily move on to an person tech interview 
with your future manager, and things really click. You get an offer
that is competitive with your current position, and you take the new gig.

2 months into the new job, you look back on the HR promises and the 
great conversation with your now manager with regret, 
- team members aren't what they were advertized as
- OpenSource involvement is valued, but no resources are given to it
- your boss chose a different technology, and your XYZ skills are left behind
