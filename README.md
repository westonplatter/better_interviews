## Why?

### TL;DR
Questions to probe quality of future job prospects.

### Story
While fixing bugs and browsing solutions on stackoverflow.com, you see 
an interesting job. You read the description, and the gig seems way
more execiting that fixing the 20 bugs in your work que.

You apply for the job, and have a phone screen with HR. The 
enthusiastic HR recruiter describes, 
- the amazing team you will be placed on  
- the emphasis on giving back to Open Source  
- your value to the company because of your work with XYZ  

After the phone screen, you easily move to an in person interview 
with your future manager, and things really click. You get an offer
that is competitive with your current position, and take the new gig.

2 months into the new job, you look back on the HR promises and the 
great conversation with your now manager with regret, 
- my team members seem to have changed
- I am not contributing to OpenSource
- I am working on what I was hired to do
